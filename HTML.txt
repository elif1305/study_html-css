####  What is the HTML

-> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

-> HTML is a markup language used to create documents on the web. 
It describes the structure and layout of a web page.

## HTML Page Structure

-> The <head> element contains metadata about the page. 
HTML metadata is data about the HTML document and metadata is not displayed. 
Metadata typically defines the document title, character set, styles, scripts,
and other meta information.

-> The <body> element indicates what should appear in the main browser window.

A Simple HTML Document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!-- This is a comment-->
        <img src="https://JJJHJGJH" alt="APPLE" width="100%" height="auto" border="2px">
        <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Welcome GOOGLE</a>
        <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u4ycVa0PK" alt="A lighthouse" width="50%" height="auto"></a>
</body>
</html>

-> The alt attribute is used to provide an alternate text for an image in case
 the image fails to load on a web page or it is not supported by the browser, etc.
Moreover, Visually impaired users browse the web via screen reading software. 
the screen reading software can read the text inside an alt attribute for impaired users.
We should add alt attribute to the image tag just like the src attribute.
